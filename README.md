========

GenSheet is a spreadsheet [xls and ods] generator for Roo.
Roo is awesome at reading and processing spreadsheets all on its own but has no file generation.

During export sheet data and formatting is preserved from the original sheet or Roo object.
This allows you to use spreadsheets as templates, loading them with Roo, filling or altering data, then exporting.

Future plans are to add in-sheet hooks and data markers to allow for true template-like handling of source sheets.
