GenSheet

Spreadsheet generator for Roo.

Allows sheets and sheet data loaded or created from Roo to be exported/saved as xls or ods.
During export sheet data and formatting is preserved from the original sheet or modified Roo data as possible.
This allows you to use spreadsheets as templates, loading them with roo, filling or altering data, then exporting.

Future plans are to add in-sheet hooks and data markers to allow for true template-like handling of source sheets.
